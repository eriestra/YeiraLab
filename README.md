Yeira Lab contains our set of examples for the Bloom Content Production Toolkit.

These examples are brought by Yeira ELearning, a SaaS LMS based in Mexico that services the LATAM market and other countries. For more information, please visit https://www.yeira.training

The Bloom Toolkit works with Yeira exclusively, so if you want to use this repository you must open an account with Yeira, clone this repository or get a zip version of it, and use the provided templates (config.yaml, pages.yaml and index.html). If you need help with setting up your account, do not hesitate contacting us at soporte@yeira.training.
